A Flutter chat app using Firebase is a mobile application that enables users to communicate with each other in real-time through text messages. The app leverages Firebase services such as Firestore for storing chat messages and Firebase Authentication for user authentication and authorization.

Key features of the app may include:
- User registration and login using email/password or social media accounts
- Real-time messaging functionality for sending and receiving text messages

The app's user interface is designed to be user-friendly and engaging, with chat bubbles, timestamps, and read receipts to enhance the messaging experience. Firebase is utilized to handle the backend infrastructure, ensuring reliable and scalable performance for handling chat messages and user interactions in real-time.
